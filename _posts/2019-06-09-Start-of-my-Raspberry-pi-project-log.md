As a person who has already failed two times learning "coding", 
I thought this time, it's gonna be my one and last time trying to learn programming.
And finally, I'm starting to find programming interesting. 

I contribute this a lot to raspberry pi. 
Looking back, the most difficulty I had learning coding was: "so what?, what is it gonna do?".
One and a half years ago, without any knowledge of computer science or programming, I started learning "data science".
Though I started studying it very willfully, without weak programming, it was a misery.
Because I didn't understand anything like class, method, parameter, arguments, 
it became almost impossible to me to actually start handling data.

The failure was real and cruel...
It only felt so intangible. I always asked myself "what am I doing?", or "Is this worth it?". 
Since the "intangible-ness" or "abstractness" was a big problem for me, this time I set my goal differently when I started out learning again.

'''
don't be limited learning theories
make something practical and useful in real life

This is how I started this project.
I feel very proud that I have started this project.
I'd like to express my great gratitude to my friend Sangwoo who helped me starting this project.

Without further ado, I'd like to start jotting down some of my project progress logs.
